U-Boot for Sensity System Falcon boards

This file contains information for the port of
U-Boot to the Sensity Systems Falcon board,
based on the Freescale i.MX6 Quad SOC.

Building U-Boot for the original (pre-beta) Falcon:

$ make mx6qfalcon_config
$ make

Building U-Boot for the current Falcon (with 2GiB of DRAM):

$ make mx6qfalcon2g_config
$ make

Alternate U-Boot for manufacturing images:

$ make mx6qfalcon_mfg_config # or mx6qfalcon2g_mfg_config
$ make


The manufacturing version differs from the standard U-Boot in
the following ways:

* Environment variables are builtin and volatile - no eMMC storage
* Bootdelay is set to 5 seconds, rather than zero
* Boot failure checks disabled
* No "boot retry" timeout at the U-Boot prompt\
